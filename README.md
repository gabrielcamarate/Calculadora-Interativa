# Interactive Calculator in C
I would like to present the source code of a C language calculator, developed as part of a project for a college course.

This calculator features an interactive user interface based on the terminal, implemented using the NCurses library.

Here are some key aspects of the code:

- Graphical Interface: Utilization of the NCurses library to create an interactive interface in the terminal.

- Implementation of buttons for digits 0 to 9
- Arithmetic Operators: Addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication
- Decimal point
- Equal (=) key and additional commands such as clear screen (C) and delete last character (<)
###
- Implementation of functions to perform mathematical operations
- User Input Control
- Handling keyboard events for user interaction.
- Input validation to ensure the validity of operations and prevent errors.

## Additional Features:

- Ability to clear the screen and delete the last entered character.

### Code Organization:

- Modular structure with specific functions for different aspects of the application.
- Use of C programming practices such as dynamic memory allocation, string manipulation, and control structures.

### NOTES:
- The calculator still has some bugs as I haven't had time to finalize it!
- The calculator is functional only for the LINUX terminal version!

***Creation for Windows terminal in progress***

- Approximately 14 days were spent in total to complete version 1.0 of this project, from ideation, scoping, and production!

### Acknowledgments
I appreciate the opportunity to present this work and am available to clarify any doubts or provide more information about specific parts of the code.

#### Thank you for your attention!
